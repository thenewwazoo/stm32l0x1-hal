//! STM32L0x1 HAL
//!
//! This HAL provides an implementation of the `embedded-hal` traits for the STM32L0x1 family of
//! microcontrollers.
//!
//! **NOTE**: This crate contains chip-specific features and modules. Where convenient, common
//! peripherals (e.g. GPIO ports) are implemented by default, but some chips have more than others.
